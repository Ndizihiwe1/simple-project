ANSWER SHEET OF WEB DESIGN S5<br><br>
SECTION A:ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS ( each question carry 5 marks)<br><br>
1.	The web is not synonymous with the Internet,, the web is a application of the Internet.<br><br>
2.	An Intranet is a mini web that is limited to the users, machines, and software programs of a specific organization. <br><br>
3.	The instructions should follow a stringent set of guidelines.<br><br>
The instructions should be included in the textual document.<br><br>
The instructions should be invisible to the end user.<br><br>

4.	Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is responsible for telling a Web browser <br><br> how text and other objects in a Web document should appear.
5.	HTML is simply a 'markup language'<br><br> used to define a logical structure rather than compute anything. <br><br>
6.	The most important difference between the two markup languages is that HyperText Markup Language,<br><br> or HTML, is an application of SGML (Standard Generalized rkup Language),1 and allows an author to omit certain tags and use attribute minimization.2 The Extensible HyperText Markup Language, or XHTML, is an application of XML (Extensible Markup Language).3 It doesn’t permit the omission of any tags or the use of attribute minimization. However, it provides a shorthand notation for empty elements—for example, we could use <br/> instead of <br></br>—which HTML does not.
7.	HTML TAGS are instructions used to format a web page content. <br><br>
These instructions are delimited. This means that they are enclosed in angle<br><br>
brackets — more commonly known as ‘‘less than’’ and ‘‘greater than’’ signs ( < and > ). <br><br>

The beginning marks contains a keyword corresponding to what<br><br> the markup should accomplish. The ending mark includes a slash(/).
<br><br>
8.<html>and <body><br><br>
9. This tag declared the language and programmer to apply to our page.<br><br> This declaration submits our pageto W3C(W<br><br>orld WideWeb Consortium) validator, which verifies whether our HTML codes do not present any error (like unclosed tags, inexisting attributes etc..), depending upon the chosen DTD(Document Type Definition).<br><br>
10. paired tags: The paired Tags are colled Open/Close tags meaning that they are always in a pair of tags one opening and the other one closing. They can contain other tags inside or a text.<br><br> 
•	Ex: <p>Ici  du texte  ou tout  autre  balise.</p> <br><br>

The opening tag is similar to the closing tag except the “/” indicating the closing area.<br><br>
•	Unpaired tags: They are called again Empty Tags, meaning that they do not contain any other HTML tag.<br><br> They don’t need to be closed.
•	Ex: <img   src="adresse/de/l/image"> <br><br>
         11.what is intranet<br><br>
        An Intranet is a mini web that is limited to the users, machines, and software programs of a 
            specific organization. <br><br>

SECTION B:ANSWER ONLY THREE QUESTIONS ( each question carry 10 marks)<br><br>
•	1. There are  4 different values for the target attribute :<br><br>
  
Value 	 	                  Description 	 
_self	                                         Displays in the current frame (default).
_blank	                              opens the link in another window.
_top	                                         Displays in the totality of the current frame.
_parent	                              Displays in the frames that  envelops the
                                                     current structure


2. BMP<br><br>
The BMP file format (Windows bitmap) handles graphics files within the Microsoft Windows OS.<br><br>
JPEG<br><br>
JPEG  is used by DOS. Other operating systems may use JPEG. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a compression method. The images using that format are usually stored in the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) file format.<br><br>
GIF<br><br>
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors. This makes the GIF format suitable for storing graphics with relatively few colors such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos and cartoon style images.<br><br>
PNG<br><br>
The PNG, (Portable Network Graphics) file format was created as the free, open-source successor to the GIF.<br><br>
3.adventages<br><br>
1.one adventage  is that it quickly gives the viewer some idea of
the graphic to come. <br><br>
2.This peek may be enough to make some important deci-
sions.<br><br> For instance, if the graphic is a familiar imagemap, the user can use the link
to go to another page before the entire image has downloaded.<br><br> 
3.In some cases, the<br><br>
partially downloaded image might be enough for the viewer to decide that she
doesn’t want to wait for the rest.<br><br>
Disadvantages<br><br>
1 it will slightly increase the file size of the resulting graphic. <br><br>
2. There are also aesthetic considerations involved that come down to a matter of personal taste.<br><br>
3. Some viewers would rather see nothing at all than look at the temporary visual chaos an interlaced GIF creates.<br><br> For these reasons, you may choose to limit interlacing to instances when it makes sense, such as for large imagemaps, instead of using it for every small graphic on a page.<br><br>

4. An audio file format is a file format for storing audio data on a computer system. <br><br>
1. WAVE (.wav)<br><br>
2. AIFF (.aif, .aiff)<br><br>
3. LAW (.au)<br><br>
4. MPEG (.mpa, .mp2, .mp3)<br><br>
5. MIDI (.mid)<br><br>
5. What is the role of POST and GET methods?<br><br>

The built-in GET function is used to collect values from a form sent with method="get".<br><br>
Information sent from a form with the GET method is visible to everyone (it will be displayed in the browser's address bar) and has limits on the amount of information to send (max. 100 characters).<br><br>
The built-in POST function is used to collect values from a form sent with method="post".<br><br>
Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others and has no limits on the amount of information to send.<br><br>
